Topics covered in the course include:\n- Problem solving and search,\n- Knowledge representation, reasoning and planning,\n- Reasoning and decision- making in the presence of uncertainty\n- Selected topics in AI. Machine learning.\nPrerequisites Knowledge of math (calculus and algebra), probabilities, algorithm design, and programming skills are necessary to successfully complete the class.\nTextbook S.

        "text": "There will be weekly homework assignments that will include a mix of theoretical and programming problems. The homework assignments files (reports and programs) will be submitted via Canvas. Please see homework assignments guidelines for more detail.\nCollaboration All the work in this course should be done independently. Collaborations on quizzes,\nexams and homework assignments are not permitted.\nGenerative AI Policy The homeworks and examinations will require you to think critically and explain your work in your own words. You may not use ChatGPT or any other generative AI software to create answers for anything in this course. In my experience, it is often easy to tell when ChatGPT has been used to generate answers from question prompts, and those answers are usually not very good. \"Prompt engineering\" is not worth your time. Writing down your thoughts, and iterating on those thoughts, is one of the most effective ways to build your own knowledge on a subject - don't deprive yourself of that opportunity by asking a program to generate your \"thoughts\" for you.\nIf I feel that a response shows clear evidence of generative AI, I will award zero points for that question. I will provide an explanation of my evidence and offer you the opportunity to resubmit the offending questions.\nGrading The grade for the course will be determined by:\n- Homework assignments 70%\n- Exams 30%\nThe midterm exam will be held on (approximately) Tuesday, October 22, 2024 during the regular class time. The final exam will be held during the finals week during the regular class time.\nPolicy on Cheating Cheating and any other anti- intellectual behavior, including giving your work to someone else, will be dealt with severely. The penalties, depending on the severity of the offense,\nmay range from the no- credit for the problem, the assignment, to the Fail (F) grade from the course. In addition, the cheating incidence may be reported to SCI school and further disciplinary actions may be taken by the school. If you feel you may have violated the rules speak to us as soon as possible.\nDisability guidelines"
